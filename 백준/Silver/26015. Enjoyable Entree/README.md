### 문제 설명

<p>For many days now, the canteen in Hilbert's Hotel has been offering its famous <em>Fibonacci Soup</em>. Today is the $n$th day that they offer the soup, and the recipe changes every day:</p>

<ul>
	<li>On the first day, it is a <em>$\pi$-tato soup</em>, made from a blend of local potato varieties, and served with onion strips and celery.</li>
	<li>On the second day, it is a <em>$\tau$-mato soup</em>, consisting of puréed tomatoes, together with carrots, onions, garlic, and basil leaves on top.</li>
	<li>On every day after that, the soup is made from two ingredients, the soup of the previous day and the soup of the day before that, mixed together in equal parts.</li>
</ul>

<p>Find the composition of today's Fibonacci Soup.</p>

### 입력 

 <p>The input consists of:</p>

<ul>
	<li>One line with a single integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 10^{18}$), the current day.</li>
</ul>

### 출력 

 <p>Output two real numbers $\pi$ and $\tau$ ($0 \le \pi,\tau \le 100$), giving the percentages of $\pi$-tato soup and $\tau$-mato soup in the $n$th day's Fibonacci soup. Your answer will be accepted if the absolute or relative error is at most $10^{-6}$.</p>
