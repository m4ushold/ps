### 문제 설명

<p>Welcome to the <strong>Lucky 777 Slot Game</strong>! This game is known for its complex mathematical challenges, where only the smartest can win the jackpot.</p>

<p>The slot machine is powered by a mysterious sequence—the <strong>Fibonacci sequence</strong>. But it’s no ordinary Fibonacci sequence; it has a twist inspired by the number $7$, the symbol of luck in slot games.</p>

<p>When you pull the lever of the <strong>Lucky 777 Slot Machine</strong>, it generates a gigantic number using an integer $n$ and the power of sevens: $7^{7^{7^n}}$. This number, however, is so massive that even the most powerful computers cannot handle it directly.</p>

<p>To claim the jackpot, you need to compute the last $10$ digits of the $F_{7^{7^{7^n}}}$, the $7^{7^{7^n}}$-th Fibonacci number.</p>

### 입력 

 <p>The frst line contains an integer $t$ indicating the number of test cases. Each of the following $t$ lines is a test case and contains exactly one positive integer $n$.</p>

### 출력 

 <p>For each test case, output one line contains the last $10$ digits of $F_{7^{7^{7^n}}}$.</p>
