### 문제 설명

<p>We were afraid of making this problem statement too boring, so we decided to keep it short.</p>

<p>A sequence is called non-boring if its every connected subsequence contains a unique element, i.e. an element such that no other element of that subsequence has the same value.</p>

<p>Given a sequence of integers, decide whether it is non-boring.</p>

### 입력 

 <p>The first line of the input contains the number of test cases T. The descriptions of the test cases follow:</p>

<p>Each test case starts with an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 200 000) denoting the length of the sequence. In the next line the n elements of the sequence follow, separated with single spaces. The elements are non-negative integers less than 10<sup>9</sup>.</p>

### 출력 

 <p>Print the answers to the test cases in the order in which they appear in the input. For each test case print a single line containing the word non-boring or boring.</p>
